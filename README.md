# antares_lssttds
Jupyter notebooks implementing a mini version of ANTARES for the "Building the
Infrastructure for Time-Domain Alert Science in the LSST Era" workshop

There's two notebooks, one on `machine_learning` and the other on
`streaming_data`

`machine_learning` needs you to install a couple of extra python packages
`streaming_data` needs you to download a large data file

PICK YOUR OWN ADVENTURE!!!
